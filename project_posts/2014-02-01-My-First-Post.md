__"Where Have My Words Gone?"__

Our first plan is here.

![Our First Plan](../project_images/post1.jpg?raw=true "Our First Plan")

Masahide already has had some ideas and prototypes.
We chose the idea that is 3D typography using Web Speech API.
The product will get speech input via Google Chrome Web Speech API, convert it to 3D typography and print it to screen.

- Google Chrome Web Speech API
- Web Socket
- openFrameworks App
- Projection

We're going to try 3D projection to utilize features of 3D text.
And we try to make some nice sound on surround system.
