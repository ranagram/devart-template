Today, we did projection test to check how 3D text looks.

1. put silver coated large paper in the wall.
2. project the app view via 2 projector through polarization seat.
3. watch app view through glasses with polarization seat.

Then we have some tasks.

- We can't recognize it to 3D without correct mapping.
- The visual gets better with lower parallax.
- It also gets better with deeper perspective.
